## Simplifying the code:

File name | Description
--------- | ------------
[0-positive_or_negative.c]( https://github.com/tizihoxha/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/variables_if_else_while/0-positive_or_negative.c) | Print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.
[1-last_digit.c]( https://github.com/tizihoxha/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/variables_if_else_while/1-last_digit.c) | Prints the last digit of the number stored in the variable n .
[2-print_alphabet.c](https://github.com/tizihoxha/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/variables_if_else_while/2-print_alphabet.c) | Program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
[3-print_alphabets.c]( https://github.com/tizihoxha/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/variables_if_else_while/3-print_alphabets.c) |  Program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line
[4-print_alphabt.c](https://github.com/tizihoxha/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/variables_if_else_while/4-print_alphabt.c)| Program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line, EXCEPT THE LETTERS q and e. 
[5-print_numbers.c](https://github.com/tizihoxha/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/variables_if_else_while/5-print_numbers.c)| Program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
[6-print_numberz.c](https://github.com/tizihoxha/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/variables_if_else_while/6-print_numberz.c)| Program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line .
[7-print_tebahpla.c](https://github.com/tizihoxha/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/variables_if_else_while/7-print_tebahpla.c)| Program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.
[8-print_base16.c](https://github.com/tizihoxha/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/variables_if_else_while/8-print_base16.c)| Program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.
[9-print_comb.c](https://github.com/tizihoxha/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/variables_if_else_while/9-print_comb.c)| Program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers, numbers are separated 
[100-print_comb3.c]( https://github.com/tizihoxha/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/variables_if_else_while/100-print_comb3.c)| Program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits, numbers must be separated
