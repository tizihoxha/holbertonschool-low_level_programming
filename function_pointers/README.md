# Function pointers

## [function_pointers in C](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/840501/how-do-function-pointers-in-c-work)


A function pointer is a variable that stores the address of a function that can later be called through that function pointer. This is useful because functions encapsulate behavior. For instance, every time you need a particular behavior such as drawing a line, instead of writing out a bunch of code, all you need to do is call the function. But sometimes you would like to choose different behaviors at different times in essentially the same piece of code.
