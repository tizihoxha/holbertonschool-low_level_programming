# C - Hello, World

## Important C concepts
**This is the first introduction to C programming language.**
### C is :
***A high-level and general-purpose programming language that is ideal for developing firmware or portable applications.***

[Everything you need to know to start with C](https://holbertonintranet.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/misc/2021/1/d801279f75de6a982a55d752dfd3632909f720f0.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOU5BHMTQX4%2F20220611%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20220611T155019Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=09e3f1d2d1ce5806e4aeb6a7551bd8347694fb5d35cac09364a09246d7d59fb4)

Important C commands:

- [`gcc`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/gcc.1.html)
- [`printf (3)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/printf.3.html)
- [`puts`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/puts.3.html)
- [`putchar`](https://linux.die.net/man/3/putchar)


### Simplifying the code:
Tasks | Description
--------- | ------------
[0-preprocessor](https://github.com/tizihoxha/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/hello_world/0-preprocessor) | Runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file
[1-compiler](https://github.com/tizihoxha/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/hello_world/1-compiler) | Compiles a C file but does not link
[2-assembler](https://github.com/tizihoxha/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/hello_world/2-assembler) | Generates the assembly code of a C code and saves it in an output file
[3-name](https://github.com/tizihoxha/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/hello_world/3-name) | Compiles a C file and creates an executable named `cisfun`
[4-puts.c](https://github.com/tizihoxha/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/hello_world/4-puts.c) | Prints `"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle"`
[5-printf.c](https://github.com/tizihoxha/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/hello_world/5-printf.c) | Prints `with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art`
[6-size.c](https://github.com/tizihoxha/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/hello_world/6-size.c) | Prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled
[100-intel](https://github.com/tizihoxha/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/hello_world/100-intel) | Generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file
[101-quote.c](https://github.com/tizihoxha/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/hello_world/101-quote.c) | Prints `and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19`
