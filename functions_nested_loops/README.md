# C - Functions, nested loops

### [1. Nested while loops](https://www.programiz.com/csharp-programming/nested-loops)

A nested while loop is ***a while statement inside another while statement.*** In a nested while loop, one iteration of the outer loop is first executed, after which the inner loop is executed. The execution of the inner loop continues till the condition described in the inner loop is satisfied.

### [2. C - Functions](https://www.w3schools.com/c/c_functions.php#:~:text=A%20function%20is%20a%20block,and%20use%20it%20many%20times.)

A function is a ***block of code which only runs when it is called.*** You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. Functions are used to perform certain actions, and they are important for reusing code: Define the code once, and use it many times.

### [3. C - Header Files](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_header_files.htm#:~:text=A%20header%20file%20is%20a,that%20comes%20with%20your%20compiler.)

A header file is ***a file with extension . h which contains C function declarations and macro definitions to be shared between several source files.*** There are two types of header files: the files that the programmer writes and the files that comes with your compiler.
