# Debugging

**Debugging, in computer programming and engineering, is a multistep process that involves identifying a problem, isolating the source of the problem, and then either correcting the problem or determining a way to work around it. The final step of debugging is to test the correction or workaround and make sure it works.**

#### Simplifying the code:

Tasks | Code description
--------- | ------------
[main.h](https://github.com/tizihoxha/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/debugging/0-main.c) | Header filer
[0-main.c](https://github.com/tizihoxha/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/debugging/0-main.c) | Test that function `positive_or_negative()` gives the correct output when given a case of `0`.
[1-main.c](https://github.com/tizihoxha/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/debugging/1-main.c) | Fixed that program so it stops the infinte loop.
[2-largest_number.c](https://github.com/tizihoxha/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/debugging/2-largest_number.c) | Fixed the program so it prints the largest integer.
[3-print_remaining_days.c](https://github.com/tizihoxha/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/debugging/3-print_remaining_days.c) | Takes a date and prints how many days are left in the year (includes leap years).
