# Preprocessor

In computer science, a preprocessor (or precompiler) is **a program that processes its input data to produce output that is used as input to another program.** The output is said to be a preprocessed form of the input data, which is often used by some subsequent programs like compilers.

***[The C Preprocessor is not a part of the compiler, but is a separate step in the compilation process.](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_preprocessors.htm)***
